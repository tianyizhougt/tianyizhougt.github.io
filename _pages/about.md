I am a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University's Data Science Institute, working with [Samory Kpotufe](https://www.columbia.edu/~skk2175/) (Department of Statistics) and [Qiang Du](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/qiang-du) (Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics). My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of deep learning. I study the statistical and computational principles that drive the success of deep learning, with the goal of enhancing the performance of systems that leverage these technologies. Recently, I have been interested in the theory and practice of network intrusion detection in cybersecurity.

I received my Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Georgia Institute of Technology [ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Xiaoming Huo](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xiaoming-huo). Born and raised in Hong Kong, I completed my B.Sc. in Statistics with first-class honors at the University of Hong Kong in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to study mathematics and statistics as an exchange student at UCLA in 2019.
