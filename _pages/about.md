I am a fourth-year Machine Learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology [ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoming Huo](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xiaoming-huo). I study the theoretical aspects of deep learning. Specifically, I study statistical learning theories for deep learning from generalization and approximation perspectives. I am also interested in the optimization theories of deep learning.

Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Statistics with first-class honors at the University of Hong Kong. I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Qiang Fu](https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/qiang-fu/) (Sociology @ UBC) and Prof. [Xin Guo](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/11757/xin-guo) (Math @ University of Queensland) on computational social science. I was an Overseas Research Fellow in 2019, working with Prof [Ming Yuan](https://www.columbia.edu/~my2550/) at Columbia University, New York. 

I was an exchange student at UCLA in 2019, studying mathematics.
