 * I am originally from Hong Kong. To my fellow Hongkongers, if you come across this page, please reach out!
 * My name Tian-Yi (天意) literally means God's will. You can call me Tian, Tian-Yi, God's will, or GW, whatever you like the best. 
 * Outside of research, I enjoy shopping at Costco and listening to Taylor Swift. 
 * Don't ask me, "What's your favorite Taylor Swift song?"; we all know it's impossible to pick just one.
