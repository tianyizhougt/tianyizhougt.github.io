I am a fifth-year Machine Learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology [ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoming Huo](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xiaoming-huo). My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of deep learning. I study the statistical and computational principles that drive the success of deep learning, with the goal of enhancing the performance of systems that leverage these technologies. Recently, I have been interested in the theory and practice of anomaly detection, with a particular focus on network intrusion detection in cybersecurity.

Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Statistics with first-class honors at the University of Hong Kong in 2020. I was an Overseas Research Fellow in 2019, working with Prof [Ming Yuan](https://www.columbia.edu/~my2550/) at Columbia University, New York. I was an exchange student at UCLA in 2019, studying mathematics and statistics.
