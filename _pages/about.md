I am a fourth-year Machine Learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoming Huo](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xiaoming-huo). I study the theoretical aspects of deep learning. My current research interests lie in the intersection of approximation theory and statistical learning theory.

Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Statistics with first-class honors at the University of Hong Kong. I was an Overseas Research Fellow in 2019, working with Prof [Ming Yuan](https://www.columbia.edu/~my2550/) at Columbia University, New York.
